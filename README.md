# Stanford-AI4ALL-Robotics

Welcome to the official repository for the **Robotics Team** at the Stanford AI4ALL 2025 summer program! This repository contains project materials, code, datasets, and documentation used during the two-week AI4ALL camp.

## 📌 Overview

As part of the Stanford AI4ALL initiative, students in the Robotics team explore how artificial intelligence can power autonomous robots through computer vision, motion planning, and control systems. This project is designed to simulate a real-world automation task.

## 👩‍💻 Project Goal

Build an AI-powered robotic system that can:
- Recognize and classify objects based on visual features like color and shape
- Control a robotic arm (in simulation) to pick up and sort objects into appropriate bins

## 🧠 Learning Objectives

Participants will:
- Use OpenCV to process camera input and extract visual features
- Train a machine learning model to classify objects
- Integrate vision and classification outputs with robotic control
- Simulate robot behavior using PyBullet
- Learn the fundamentals of motion planning and robotics AI integration

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies

- Python 3.8+
- OpenCV
- PyBullet
- Google Colab
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (optional)
- ROS (Robot Operating System) – optional for advanced exploration

## ▶️ Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hvcho/Stanford-AI4ALL-Robotics.git
   cd Stanford-AI4ALL-Robotics
   ```

2. **Install required packages**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run notebooks**
   - Use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) for a cloud-based setup
   - Or run locally using Jupyter:
     ```bash
     pip install notebook  # If you don't have Jupyter installed
     jupyter notebook
     ```
